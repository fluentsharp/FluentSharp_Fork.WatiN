FluentSharp Fork of WatiN
=======

Original Fork
=====
* Code Created from Snapshop http://sourceforge.net/p/watin/code/1217/tarball 
  I tried to do a svn import was having an an ASLR prob with git and perl (see http://www.baselogic.com/blog/development/perl-exe-fatal-error-unable-remap-cygwin-dll-address-parent/ and http://www.mylifestartingup.com/2009/04/fatal-error-unable-to-remap-to-same.html 
* this was a 60Mb zipped and 170Mb on the file system, so for the first commit I removed (from watin-code-1217-trunk) the folders:
** examples
** lib\Net\2.0
** tools
** src\BrowserDrivers\WebDriver\packages
** src\BrowserDrivers\WebDriver\src\chromedriver.exe
** go.bat
** WatiN.build


  with this files deleted the main watin-code-1217-trunk folder had 16Mb (3.6 zipped)
